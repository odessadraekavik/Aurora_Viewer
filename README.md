![Aurora Viewer in Second Life](docs/screenshots/scene.jpg)

Aurora Viewer is a Second Life client built from scratch in Rust, with a
modern GPU renderer (wgpu on Vulkan) and a clean, flat interface. It follows
the behaviour of [Firestorm](https://www.firestormviewer.org) — same protocol,
same rules, same defaults — while rethinking the user interface.

> **Status:** early development (0.x). Usable for exploring, chatting and
> testing; many features are still in progress — see [TASKS.md](TASKS.md).

## How Aurora differs from Firestorm

**What it is**

- A Second Life viewer written from scratch in Rust; it is not a fork of
  the Linden or Firestorm codebase.
- It speaks the same protocol as Firestorm (same messages, capabilities,
  request rates and defaults), so the servers see a well-behaved, familiar
  client.
- Open source (GPL-3.0-or-later), with credit to the Linden / Firestorm code
  it ports logic from (see [NOTICE.md](NOTICE.md)).

**Rendering engine**

- Vulkan (through wgpu) instead of OpenGL.
- The GPU does the heavy lifting: it decides what is visible (culling in
  compute shaders) and builds its own draw lists.
- Bindless textures and multi-draw-indirect let thousands of objects be
  drawn in a handful of calls.
- A dedicated render thread draws frame N while the main thread already
  prepares frame N+1.
- Texture and mesh decoding runs on background threads and writes straight
  into GPU staging memory, so arriving in a busy region doesn't freeze the
  picture.
- Same look as Firestorm: PBR and legacy materials, EEP sky, shadows,
  reflection probes, mirrors, water, glow and particles, checked side by
  side on the main grid.

**Performance**

Measured on 10 October 2026 with the frame cap off, on one PC (RTX 4090), in
one busy store of about 16,000 objects. This is an informal test, not a
benchmark:

- 138 fps where Firestorm gave 68 fps at the same spot;
- about 343 fps at that spot (median) once the render thread landed, 386 fps
  in the capture above.

The texture memory budget is set automatically from the detected VRAM.

**Interface**

- A flat, modern interface of our own: a single top bar, a notification
  center, searchable conversations and a redesigned performance window.
- Teleport and loading screens show the blurred last view and real
  step-by-step progress.
- Teleports within the same region are instant, with no loading screen.
- Movement keys adapt to the keyboard layout on first launch (WASD or ZQSD).

**Things Firestorm doesn't have**

- Link safety check: web links in chat and profiles are marked trusted,
  unknown or dangerous, judged locally with nothing sent anywhere.
- Parcel permission icons show everything, green for allowed and red for
  forbidden; Firestorm shows only the restrictions.
- HUDs can be moved directly with Alt + drag (the key is configurable),
  without opening the build tools.
- Local chat bubbles show the speaker's profile picture.
- The remembered password is kept in Windows Credential Manager, as a hash
  only.
- An offline demo mode simulates a server locally, so the viewer can be
  tested with no account and no grid connection.

## What works today

- **Rendering** — wgpu / Vulkan, bindless textures, multi-draw-indirect,
  PBR and legacy materials, shadows, reflection probes, water, glow,
  particles, GPU occlusion (experimental).
- **Avatars** — skeleton and Bento animations blended like Firestorm,
  server bakes, shape, rigged mesh, complexity limits, impostors, look-at.
- **World** — prims, sculpts, mesh with LOD, terrain, EEP environment,
  world sounds, parcel music, media on prims.
- **Social** — local chat, IMs and groups, people list, blocking,
  notifications, voice (WebRTC).
- **Interface** — flat Aurora theme, Phosphor icons, mini-map and world map,
  inventory, preferences, debug overlays.

## Roadmap

**Not there yet**

- Search, snapshots, gestures, RLVa, the shape and clothing editors, group
  profiles, and the full sky / water editors.
- Voice is WebRTC only (no Vivox).
- Linux and macOS builds: the code is portable but not validated.

**Planned**

- NVIDIA DLSS upscaling and DLAA anti-aliasing.
- Frame Generation (under investigation).
- Faster texture loading: a GPU-compressed texture cache, so revisited
  places skip JPEG2000 decoding, and about 4× less VRAM per texture.
- PBR terrain, projector lights and a full pass on water rendering.
- Maybe a VR mode with controller support.

The detailed list of what is done, in progress and to do is in
[TASKS.md](TASKS.md).

## Build

Requirements: Windows 10/11, [Rust](https://rustup.rs) (stable, selected
automatically by `rust-toolchain.toml`), a GPU with Vulkan support.

**Development environment:** create a folder for the project, clone this
repository into it, then double-click **`aurora-tools.cmd`**:

```bat
git clone https://github.com/Aurora-Viewer/Aurora-Viewer aurora-viewer
```

The tools check the environment and offer to **repair** it: they install
whatever is missing (GitHub CLI, the Visual Studio C++ tools, Rust), clone
the Firestorm sources next to the repository, and download the emoji font,
the Rust toolchain and the crates. Then, driven by the keyboard: release /
dev / debug viewers, demo, agents' tasks, disk, logs, live pull requests with
Windows notifications, releases (see
[HUMANS.md](HUMANS.md)).

Without Git yet, this command (in a command prompt, in the project folder)
installs everything, Git included:

```bat
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "$f = Join-Path $env:TEMP 'aurora-setup.ps1'; irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aurora-Viewer/Aurora-Viewer/main/scripts/setup.ps1 -OutFile $f; & $f"
```

Or by hand, to build the viewer only:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Aurora-Viewer/Aurora-Viewer aurora-viewer
cd aurora-viewer
./scripts/fetch-assets.ps1          # emoji font (too large for git)
cargo build --release -p aurora-viewer
./target/release/aurora-viewer.exe
```

Run the same checks as the CI with `./scripts/check.ps1` (rustfmt, clippy
with warnings as errors, tests). Day-to-day development uses the default
profile (`cargo run -p aurora-viewer`): it behaves like the release build
without its slow link-time optimization. `./scripts/build-release.ps1`
builds GitHub's latest `main` with `--release` into `..\RELEASE\`.

### Command line

| Argument | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--title <text>` | Names the window "Aurora Viewer - <text> (Dev)" and its log file |
| `--fps-limit <fps>` | Caps this instance at 1–500 fps without changing saved preferences |
| `-h`, `--help` | Shows the help |

- `--title`: the build profile ends the title (Dev, Release, Debug); the log
  file is `aurora-<text>.log` (`aurora-demo-<text>.log` in demo mode).
- `--fps-limit`: applies an extra limit to this process, including captures
  and online sessions; a lower user preference remains effective.

The frame limiter is enabled at **120 fps by default** and can be disabled
or adjusted in Préférences › Graphismes › Fluidité. Saved preferences are
preserved.

### Test switches

The offline **demo mode** simulates a server locally (a plaza, avatars,
objects, chat, notifications…): no connection, no account. It keeps its own
settings and cache (`…\config\demo`, `…\cache\demo`).

```powershell
$env:AURORA_DEMO = "1"
cargo run -p aurora-viewer
```

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `AURORA_DEMO=1` | Offline demo mode |
| `AURORA_DEMO_<NAME>=…` | A demo scenario: a window, a stress scene, a camera script… |
| `AURORA_CAPTURE=<file.png>` | Saves a capture of a frame |
| `AURORA_PROFILE=1` | Writes one profiling line per second to the log |

The full list of switches (demo scenarios, captures, forced settings,
diagnostics) and how to read the profiling output are in
[docs/TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.md) (in French).

Logs are in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Aurora\AuroraViewer\data\logs\`.
